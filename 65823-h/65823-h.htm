</div>

<p>The science of infant-feeding has been revolutionized
in the last twenty years, and, in the
process, it has advanced too radically in many
directions. Lately, the pendulum has been
swinging backward, so that the most advanced
knowledge of today probably represents a middle
ground between extreme radicalism and extreme
conservatism. In no other direction is this more
manifest than in the feeding intervals. The
religious adherence to the four-hour feeding
interval is giving way to a more rational system.
I am one of the firmest adherents of the longer
interval: the food is better digested, the stomach
has a period of rest, and the general well-being
of the infant is better furthered than with more
frequent feedings. But there are certain infants
who do not receive enough nourishment in this
interval, especially young breast-fed infants in
whom it can be demonstrated by accurate weighing,
before and after nursing, that they receive
considerably more milk in twenty-four hours
with the three-hour interval. This is the more
important in that Rosenstern has demonstrated
that a large proportion of infants up to the age
of six weeks require more than the usual 100
calories per kilogram of body-weight. One hundred
calories represents 150 grams of breast-milk,
so that a five-kilo, or eleven-pound, baby should
receive a minimum of 750 c.c. of breast-milk in
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>By far the best food for the healthy infant
in every way&mdash;and this cannot be emphasized too
strongly&mdash;is mother’s milk. There are certain
alimentary disturbances in which it may be advisable
to replace breast-milk with certain artificially
prepared foods, such, for instance, as
albumin milk in alimentary intoxication; but this
is never true of the normally healthy infant.
While, as regards growth and freedom from
digestive disturbances, certain artificially prepared
foods may, when used with exceeding care,
produce as good results as breast-milk; nevertheless,
this is only one function of breast-milk.
The other function which can be imparted to no
artificial food is the passive immunization of the
child against infection. Ehrlich (<i>Zeit. f. Hyg.
u. Infectionskr.</i>, 1892, xii, 183) has proved that
antibodies, antitoxin, and agglutinins are transmitted
directly through the milk from mother to
child; and it has been shown that the blood of
a breast-fed child is considerably more bactericidal
than the blood of a bottle-fed infant.</p>

<p>The practice of weaning the baby for trivial
reasons has increased in the last decade, and can
be laid largely at the door of the medical profession.
For all practical purposes the only absolute
indication for weaning the baby is open
tuberculosis in the mother. For the last few
years I have been making a systematic inquiry
at the University Dispensary and Infant Welfare
Stations as to reasons for weaning young infants;
and in nine cases out of ten, the answer
has been that “the milk gave out.” In only a
very small proportion of cases has an ordinarily
well-nourished mother insufficient milk; far
oftener the fault lies with the child. Insufficient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
and late development of the sucking reflex prevents
these infants from completely emptying
the breast, which in time “dries up.” This
period can be tided over by nursing from both
breasts, by temporarily increasing the number of
nursings, or temporarily employing “allaitement
mixte.” In cases in which, after long, patient
effort the supply of milk is still insufficient, either
supplementary or complementary feeding of
cow’s milk can be given. Where this mixed feeding
is employed a minimum amount of cow’s
milk should be given; and the opening in the
nipple should be as small as possible, otherwise
the child gets too much cow’s milk, and with too
little effort, and gradually refuses the breast.</p>

<p>Another excuse, and one fostered to some extent
by physicians, is, that certain breast-milks
are “poison for the baby.” This has even less
foundation in fact; and here again the fault must
be looked for in the baby rather than in the
mother. Outside of certain variations in the
fat-content, all breast-milks are alike in composition.
In proof of this Finkelstein has fed these
babies at the breast of tried wet-nurses with absolutely
no benefit, while the children of the wet-nurses
would thrive at the breast of the “poison-milk
mother.”</p>

<p>Abscess of both breasts may force a temporary
cessation of nursing, but the breast should be
regularly emptied until the inflammation has
subsided; and then the nursing should be re-established.
Cracked or sunken nipples may
render nursing impossible, but they do not stop
the flow of milk. In both these latter conditions
the milk may be manually expressed or removed
with the breast-pump. In this connection I wish
to recommend the improved Jaschke pump, in
which, by means of a releasing valve, the sucking
movements of the child can be very closely
imitated.</p>

<p>Where artificial feeding must be started early,
cow’s milk is almost universally employed.
Whenever possible, “certified milk” should be
used; the ordinary milk, however, can be boiled
with little or no harm. In diluting and preparing
this milk, we have the choice of several methods.
The so-called percentage feeding, favored
in America, is difficult and cumbersome, and has
no advantages over its simpler rivals. Pfaundler’s
rule may be safely employed. It is as follows:
One-tenth body-weight of milk, one one-hundredth
body-weight of sugar diluted up to
one liter; give 200 c.c. five times in twenty-four
hours. Even simpler is the following: One-third
milk for the first month, one-half for the
second month, two-thirds for the third and
fourth months, each with the addition of 4 to 6
per cent sugar. Either milk-sugar or ordinary
granulated sugar may be employed. The malt
sugars and extracts should be reserved for sick
children. After the second month, oatmeal
water may be used as a diluent in place of plain
water.</p>

<p>Recently Friedenthal, a Berlin physiologist,
has attempted an exact imitation of mother’s
milk, including that important element, the salt,
which had, until recently, been entirely neglected.
Langstein is very enthusiastic over this milk as a
food for healthy infants; but Finkelstein, in a
personal communication, assured me that it has
not as yet proved itself. Schloss, dissatisfied
with the results of the Friedenthal milk, has
modified it in the direction of casein milk by replacing
the milk-sugar with the malt preparations,
and increasing the protein content. He claims
good results, and is supported by Leopold, of
New York, who has used it extensively. But we
must leave the final word as to both these milks
for the future to decide. From the sixth to the
ninth month for both breast-fed and bottle-fed
babies, cooked cereals, toast, and vegetables
should be gradually added to the diet. At the
ninth month, unless this is one of the hot summer
months, the nursling should be weaned, and a
small amount of cow’s milk substituted. The
weaning should be gradual by omitting one nursing
period each week. The one important exception
to the foregoing rules for the first year of
life, is the premature infant. In the ninth month
of fetal life, reserves of calcium and iron are
stored up in the body, which the infant gradually
uses up during the first nine months of extra-uterine
life. The premature infant lacks this
store, and manifests it in different ways. As
early as the second or third month a breast-fed
premature infant may develop a most extensive
craniotabes. This is not due to a true rachitis,
i.e., disturbance of calcium metabolism, but to a
want of calcium in the body. Small amounts of
cow’s milk, which contains much more calcium
than human milk, or calcium in the form of
calcium lactate or chloride, will remedy this condition.
A similar process happens in the case of
iron. The premature infant is born with a hemoglobin
percentage of 100 to 110; by the third or
fourth month this may sink to 40 per cent, and
for this reason green vegetables should be added
to the diet as early as the fourth month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>The diet of healthy children in the second year
should include cooked cereals, vegetables, toast,
cooked fruits, and meat-juices; and the quantity
of cow’s milk should be limited to one and one-half
pints in twenty-four hours. The question
of the addition of meat to the diet is important.
Some authors have recently advocated the giving
of meat as early as the ninth month. During the
past year, working in Finkelstein’s laboratory, I
have been able to gather some facts which have a
direct bearing on this question. (<i>Zeitschrift für
Kinderheilkunde</i>, July, 1914.) By means of the
new electrometric determination of absolute
acidity (that is, the number of H ions), I was
able to show that the acidity of the stomach before
the eighteenth month of life is insufficient
to permit any peptic, i. e., protein, digestion.
Solomon, working in the same clinic, in a report
not yet published, has shown the same thing from
a clinical standpoint. He found that on a meat
diet up to the end of the second year large quantities
of muscle fibers passed through with the
bowel-movement unchanged; but after that age
they rapidly decreased in number. It is, therefore,
worse than useless to add meat to the diet
before the beginning of the third year.</p>

<p>Eggs frequently produce profound disturbances
in young infants, perhaps on account of the
absorption of egg albumin, unchanged, in the
blood-stream; and they should be kept from the
diet-list until the beginning of the fourth year.</p>

<p>These rules for feeding are generalized, and
there may be many exceptions. Each child is to
some extent a law unto itself, and this is especially
true of those children with nervous or exudative
diathesis.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I wish to make a plea for greater
uniformity in our rules for infant-feeding. Even
more than in strictly medical affairs has the public
the right to demand information. Heretofore,
every new book and every public lecture on
infant-feeding has deviated markedly from its
predecessors, until the confused laity, and even
general practitioners, have turned in disgust to
proprietary foods and formulas. Pediatrics is
a new science, and as such is bound to undergo
rapid changes and conflicting opinions. But that
need not hinder us from agreeing on certain
fundamental facts which can be given as guides
to the general practitioner and to the public.</p>

<p>I believe that the simple rules for infant-feeding
here laid down are neither too conservative
nor too radical to serve as a basis of agreement
upon which the medical profession may show to
the public a united front on this important question.
Such uniformity of opinion&mdash;and the
sooner it can be reached the better&mdash;will not fail
to have a beneficial effect on both the profession
and the public.</p>

<h3>DISCUSSION</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Jacob Hvoslof</span>: I would like to ask about the
value of lime-water added to the milk. I recently had
an experience where I mixed an ounce of lime-water to
a pint of milk, as I thought that would improve it. but
for some reason or other the baby would not digest his
milk. After a while I left the lime-water out, and
everything went well. Whether this is a “post” or
“propter” I should like to find out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. O. R. Bryant</span>: In case of an exudative diathesis,
where you probably will start solids early, you
will also be able to use meat earlier. An infant that
does well on solids at six months can probably have
meat once a day at fifteen months and show a normal
stool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. S. R. Maxeiner</span>: I would like to ask Dr. Huenekens
where he classes eggs and egg albumin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. C. G. Weston</span>: I have been very much interested
in Dr. Hueneken’s paper. I care only for the babies
during the three or four weeks after birth; and of late
years many of them have passed from me directly into
the hands of the pediatrists. I formerly had the babies
nursed every three hours, but finding that the baby
specialist immediately, on assuming charge, put them
on the four-hour schedule, I changed, about a year and
a half ago, to that interval; and I thought my troubles
would cease, but such has not been the case, and it
has been my impression, as well as that of the nurses
who have had the care of the infants, that it has made
very little difference.</p>

<p>The four-hour schedule is not a new thing in Minneapolis.
Many of the older members of this Society
may remember that twenty years ago Dr. R. O. Beard
always fed his babies in this way.</p>

<p>It seems to me that we should make no hard and
fast rules for the feeding of babies, except the one that
mother’s milk should be used whenever possible. We
should individualize with the babies. If they do well
on the four-hour schedule, follow it, as it makes the
care of the child easier for the mother; if, however,
the child does not get sufficient milk on this interval to
properly nourish it, diminish the latter to three hours.</p>

<p>The only way to accurately determine how much milk
the nursing infant is getting, is to weigh the baby before
and after nursing. One is often surprised at the varying
amounts obtained by the same baby at different
nursings with no obvious difference in the condition of
the breasts. We have had a baby obtain as much as
three ounces in the first five minutes of nursing, and at
the next feeding take only one or one and a half ounces
in twenty minutes.</p>

<p>The green and frequent stools, with evidences of
colic, etc., are often found to be due to too much
milk, or taking it too rapidly; and the weighing method
is the only way to determine this.</p>

<p>I most heartily endorse what Dr. Huenekens said
with reference to the importance of encouraging in
every way maternal nursing. Many a mother gives up
the attempt to nurse her baby on account of some soreness
of the nipples or because she has thought she had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
too little milk to be of any use. Most of these cases
may become, by the means recommended by the reader,
good milkers, and many a baby’s life may thus be saved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. E. K. Green</span>: I would like to ask a question in
regard to putting babies on cow’s milk. I have adhered
very closely to the principle that modified cow’s milk is
absolutely the best food for infants, if it is impossible
to get mother’s milk, but many times when I have had
the opportunity to follow these cases carefully I have
had all sorts of stomach and bowel disturbances on
cow’s milk until someone would suggest some other
food, such as malted milk, or Mellin’s Food, or even
condensed milk, which seems to be the farthest from
the natural food, and then the babies would get along
fairly well. Is this a common experience, or is there
something wrong with my method? We have in our
own home two children brought up on the bottle, one
with malted milk and the other with Mellin’s Food. In
both these cases I tried, not only once, but several times
to use the modified cow’s milk, but failed absolutely. I
would like to know if you consider the fault usually
with the modified milk, or does the individual have
considerable to do with the case?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. A. S. Fleming</span>: I would like to ask if in the
case of the healthy infant the mother’s diet would modify
the constituents of the milk otherwise than in the
facts stated. For instance, will it modify the character
of or the percentage of the sugar, or will any of the
aromatic constituents disturb the infant’s digestion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. M. J. Jensen</span>: Dr. Huenekens dealt with the
feeding of the healthy infant only. I would like to
ask if it is not true that nearly all infants born alive,
are born as healthy and sound as any infant ever is, so
far as the functions of its organs and tissues are concerned?
Nature frequently decides on producing premature
births and “still”-births, rather than running the
risk of producing a sick or sickly infant. In young infants
it is very often difficult to determine when to
classify them as healthy or unhealthy, realizing the
conditions of their environment and usual care that is
given in the homes.</p>

<p>In regard to the sterilization or boiling of cow’s milk:
I do not think that children fed on pasteurized or
boiled milk develop as well as those who are fed upon
raw milk as it comes from the cow. Dr. Palmer, of
Chicago, fed seven hundred children on raw milk during
the midsummer months and only lost three of the
number. The miserable, atrophied children began to live
the moment treatment with raw milk was begun. If
the process of milking was carried out in a sanitary
manner, or by means of a suction apparatus, then cooled,
and placed in sterilized bottles, I believe we would prohibit
the development of bacteria, and save the food
which exerts so marked a protective influence upon
the infant’s organs.</p>

<p>When raw milk free of all objections cannot be obtained,
it is sometimes advisable to use another milk
product namely, buttermilk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. S. Marx White</span>: There is just one point I have
been thinking about in the discussion on the question
of infant-feeding, and that is whether Dr. Huenekens
really means us to believe that in practically all cases
the mother can furnish sufficient milk for the child.
He passed that over in saying that in nine out of ten
cases the mother gave as a reason for discontinuing
the milk that the milk gave out. Is it not true that in a
good many instances the mother needs treatment quite
as much as the infant? I do not mean medical treatment,
but management. Is it not true that an overworked,
tired, nervous, worrying mother is unable to
supply sufficient milk for the child? It has been my
impression from a very limited experience in this field,
that the mental and nervous and physical state of the
mother is a very large factor in the production of the
milk. When upset and under deleterious influences she
is really not a proper producer for the child; and the
management of the mother is often quite as important
a factor as any other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. W. H. Aurand</span>: In such cases as Dr. White
just mentioned, what are we going to do to increase
the supply of milk? Also, I would like to ask Dr.
Huenekens if he means to feed to the new-born baby
200 c.c. at a feeding?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Huenekens</span> (closing): As regards lime-water:
I cannot recommend its use. Wherever there is a
specific demand for calcium, as in premature infants or
spasmophilic cases; or where it may help to produce a
firm stool; or, as in diarrheal disturbances, it may be of
great value, but in the normal healthy infant it is of no
benefit whatever.</p>

<p>Dr. Bryant mentioned the giving of meat in exudative
diathesis: His statement that such infants can
probably have meat once a day at fifteen months, and
show normal stools, is beside the question. A normal
macroscopic stool does not necessarily mean that the
meat has been digested. However, I am now working
on this problem, that is, to determine whether an early
solid diet produces an earlier digestion of meat.</p>

<p>I would classify eggs and egg albumin as proteins,
and therefore not digestible until the beginning of the
third year: but, over and above this, there is danger of
anaphylaxis from the absorption of the unchanged egg
albumin into the blood-stream.</p>

<p>What Dr. Weston says of the feeding intervals is
very interesting. I do not want to be considered an
enemy of the four-hour feeding, for I use it wherever
possible, and I think it the best interval; but when
the infant cannot get enough in that period, we have to
choose between two evils. I think the lesser evil is to
give the child more milk at shorter intervals, and take
the risk of a slightly poorer digestion. We should, also,
wherever possible, control the amount of breast-milk by
weighing the child before and after nursing. It is highly
important to determine whether the baby is getting
too much or too little.</p>

<p>As to Dr. Green’s statement, “Modified milk” is a very
general term. What is usually meant is milk with a
high percentage of fat and a low percentage of sugar,
while malted and condensed milk have a high percentage
of carbohydrate. In my opinion, if he had used cow’s
milk without the addition of cream and with large
amounts of cane sugar, he would not have had this
trouble. But a large number of children will not do
well on this diet. We have special rules for abnormal
children with exudative and nervous diathesis.</p>

<p>In reply to Dr. Fleming’s question regarding the mother’s
diet and its effect on her milk: What the mother
eats has absolutely no effect on the composition of the
milk in any way whatever, except perhaps in the percentage
of fat. Now-a-days we do not advise any particular
foods for the mother’s diet,&mdash;anything she
likes, and can digest, plus large quantities of fluid;&mdash;otherwise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
there is no single food we advocate&mdash;none
that will make the milk richer or better, or increase
the quantity.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with Dr. Jensen that raw milk is so
far superior to boiled milk. Of course, wherever it is
possible, we should use certified milk, which does not
require boiling; but, if we have inferior cow’s milk
contaminated with bacteria, we can boil the milk with
very little harm. It is just as well digested, and the
food value just as great. There is of course slight
danger of scurvy; but that is very easily diagnosed, and
very easily cured by a little fresh milk or small doses
of orange juice. Where we have inferior milk, it should
be boiled in every case.</p>

<p>Dr. White brought up a very interesting point in
regard to nervous mothers. Their milk supply is subject
to wide fluctuations; but, if the breasts are well
emptied at each nursing, they will secrete sufficient
milk. I will admit that these cases are difficult to
handle, for the infants usually have nervous diathesis,
and do not respond well to ordinary food. The one
important point is to completely empty the breasts; and
that is the only measure we can take to increase the
supply of milk.</p>

<p>In reply to Dr. Aurand: I would feed a new-born
infant 200 c.c. at a feeding if the milk is sufficiently
diluted. The liquid part of the food passes very quickly
into the duodenum, so that, before the infant has finished
feeding, a part of this quantity has already left
the stomach.</p>

<p>In conclusion: We have an opportunity in our infant-feeding
to practice the really scientific prophylactic
medicine of the future. We can do more in preventing
infant-mortality by proper feeding than by any
other single measure; and we should encourage mothers
to bring their new-born infants to the physician for
advice on feeding, and to continue to consult him at
longer or shorter intervals during the whole of the
first year of life.</p>

  <span class="smcap">By George H. Freeman</span>, M. D.<br />

  WILLMAR, MINNESOTA</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a>
Read at the 46th annual meeting of the Minnesota
State Medical Association, St. Paul, October 1 and 2,
1914.</p>

</div>

<p>The Minnesota Legislature of 1907 passed a
bill establishing the Hospital Farm for Inebriates,
placing its management under the State
Board of Control, and providing for its maintenance
by setting aside 2 per cent of the saloon-license
money for that purpose. Later, a law
was enacted providing for the issuance of certificates
of indebtedness; and active construction
work soon commenced. The Hospital was
opened on Dec. 26, 1912, with Dr. Tomlinson,
formerly Superintendent of the St. Peter State
Hospital, at its head. Through his untimely
death, five months later, Minnesota lost one of
her most faithful officials. The principles underlying
the work at Willmar, are, with but
slight change, those that he so earnestly advocated.</p>

<p>This paper is based upon the study of the
patients admitted from the opening of the Hospital
until the close of the biennial period, on
July 31, 1914,&mdash;approximately eighteen months.</p>

<p>Patients are admitted to the Hospital following
an examination in a probate court. In such cases
there is no expense to the patient’s relatives, except
that they are expected to furnish clothing,
and a little money for the purchase of tobacco
and small luxuries. Voluntary patients are also
received following their own application in a
probate court. They pay at the rate of $1.00 a
day, each month in advance. No distinction is
made in the treatment of the two classes of patients,
except that a voluntary patient cannot be
detained if he wishes to leave. Any resident of
Minnesota who is habitually addicted to the use
of alcohol, morphine, cocaine, or other narcotics,
may be admitted to the institution, provided the
history of the patient, as furnished by a probate
court, indicates that the man can be benefited
by treatment. It is presumed that anyone can
be benefited who wants to be, unless afflicted
with irremediable chronic disease.</p>

<p>The requirement that the history be furnished,
and the ability to refuse admission, have kept
out of the Hospital many undesirable individuals
who could be cared for only under the discipline
of a well-regulated reformatory. However, some,
no matter how carefully the history is taken,
slip by. The majority of those discharged as
not proper subjects, come from that class. As
there are no accommodations for individuals
suffering with tuberculosis, no one known to be
suffering with that disease is admitted. Once
in a while a tuberculosis individual gains admittance,
but, if not too ill to be released, he is
discharged.</p>

<p>During the eighteen-month period, 209 men
and 32 women were regularly committed; and 18
men and 3 women were received as voluntary
patients. In addition to those classified as voluntary
patients, a considerable number have, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
their own volition, applied for treatment, and,
being unable to pay, have submitted to commitment,
in order to obtain treatment for their
habit.</p>

<p>There has been a fairly uniform increase in
the number of patients received each month,
which is gratifying, as showing the need of such
an institution and also as an appreciation of the
benefit that may be expected. During the last
month of the period, twenty-five patients were
admitted.</p>

<p>While the causes of inebriety are diverse, it
is a significant fact that 182 patients, out of
262, assign associates as their reason for drinking;
and observation of their history clearly
shows that they have drifted along, drinking
now and then and more and more each year.
A few assign illness, domestic trouble, or financial
worry as a cause for drinking. In only 6
instances was heredity noted. In 132 cases the
parents were abstainers.</p>

<p>We have found it impossible to formulate any
system of classification of the unfortunates under
our care. In order that some idea may be obtained
as to the number using alcohol and the
various drugs, we have constructed the following
table:</p>

<p>The treatment of the inebriate naturally divides
itself into two stages: the treatment, first,
of the immediate effects of indulgence, and, second,
such treatment as will tend to prevent a
repetition of the indulgence. The treatment of
the immediate effect of alcoholic indulgence is
regarded as the easiest part of the work. While
patients are at times received under the influence
of intoxicants, in no case have they been unruly.
For an obstreperous intoxicated person the
quickest soberer is apomorphine judiciously used;
but we have never yet resorted to it. Generally,
a fairly rapid reduction in the amount of alcohol
consumed is made, instead of immediate withdrawal.
Only in the most exceptional cases is
alcohol given over three or four days. As a
rule, during the first day it is given fairly freely.
The treatment received during this period depends
entirely upon the individual; and the treatment
of one may be entirely different from that
of another. Many receive baths at a temperature
of 98° to 100° F. for thirty or sixty minutes
for nervousness and sleeplessness. Some
receive the coal-tar hypnotics, veronal or sulphonal;
the more restless, hyoscine; and for others
paraldehyde is used,&mdash;and occasionally chloral
is used in combination with hyoscine and cannabis
indica.</p>

<p>As long as he receives alcohol, the patient remains
in bed and receives only liquid diet. In
cases of considerable digestive disturbance, capsicum
is freely used, but we have seldom found
it necessary.</p>

<p>All receive preliminary catharsis, but no attempt
is made at prolonged elimination in that
way.</p>

<p>For about a month tonic treatment with strychnine
nitrate is used in doses of 1-20 to 1-40 gr.
three times a day. Any other medication depends
entirely upon the physical condition of
the patient as revealed on examination. Only
under the most exceptional circumstances are
drugs given in alcoholic vehicle.</p>

<p>In morphine or cocaine users, the reduction
is usually made more gradually, requiring a
week to ten days. Generally, we find a patient
comfortable with one-half the drug he has been
accustomed to taking. In some cases we find
it best to reduce the quantity to about one-half
grain, and then abruptly cease.</p>

<p>Under this plan, diarrhea, cramps, restlessness,
and insomnia are much less marked. We regard
the free use of the prolonged warm bath as more
advantageous to those addicted to drugs than
to alcohol. Generally, it is the only measure
that seems to offer relief. We particularly do
not use hypodermic medication in any drug users.</p>

<p>Heroin users, who seemingly are more numerous,
receive their drug only once in twenty-four
hours. The withdrawal of the drug does not
cause the discomfort that the withdrawal of morphine
causes. Vague sensations of discomfort,
some perspiration, and insomnia are met with in
such cases.</p>

<p>No users of cocaine only have been met with,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
but in mixed forms this drug is at once withdrawn.</p>

<p>The removal of alcohol or drugs is the easiest
part of the work. Under the regular discipline
of the institution, and the absence of temptation,
the great majority of patients get along without
any trouble because of abstinence. But there is
the future to fear. The patient must go out
into the world again, and engage in the daily
struggle for his livelihood. One must aim to
put him in such condition that he may be able
to resist the temptations that will surround him
on every hand. Our work, then, is to build up
and re-educate, to strive to form a new character,
to encourage a habit of sobriety, instead of drunkenness,
to teach the man to work, to occupy himself,
to obtain for him a new outlook on life,
and to teach him his duty to himself, to his family,
and to his neighbor. Here is where our difficulty
begins. Nearly every inebriate has a firm
belief in his ability to abstain from alcohol or
drugs at any time and under any condition, because
he thinks he is not really responsible for
the condition into which he has fallen, and that,
had not certain things happened, he would not
have been drinking.</p>

<p>He is insistent in iterating and reiterating that
he has now made up his mind to stop drinking,
and that is all that is necessary. Though admitting
that, for five, ten, or fifteen years, he has
been going steadily downward, he has full confidence
in himself, and he believes injustice is
being done him when his parole is refused and
he learns that he is expected to remain until he
has strength to resist temptation.</p>

<p>In this upbuilding of body and character the
following are essential: regularity of habits, discipline,
work, food, and recreation, together with
the personal influence of the physician and those
coming into close and personal contact with the
patient.</p>

<p>Regular work is one of the most valuable of
the remedial agents at our command. It should
be suited to the individual, and, as a rule, should
not be that to which the man has been accustomed.
Particularly is this true of the man who
is used to mental labor only,&mdash;the clerk, the
physician, the pharmacist, the merchant, etc. For
them out-of-door work on the farm, lawn, or
in the garden, is the very best, and next comes
indoor shop-work. We must provide something
that engages time and attention, that provides
some new outlook upon life, and enlarges some
field of endeavor in which the patient has labored
before coming to the Hospital. Thus far the
work has been on the farm or the improvement
of the grounds, or has been carpenter, cement,
or some construction work. The women do all
the mending, and make all needed articles, such
as bedding, towels, etc. They also work in the
laundry. At present we are teaching embroidery
of various kinds, no one of our patients having
ever learned any such work.</p>

<p>The future must see us provided with shops,
especially for winter work. With a capacity of
ninety-nine men we are able to keep them fairly
well occupied during the winter months, but any
increase will have to be cared for under special
conditions.</p>

<p>A very important factor is the length of time,
as mentioned above under prognosis, that a patient
remains under care. As a general thing,
it is expected that the average patient will remain,
approximately, six months. The period of detention
is determined only after a study of the individual.
An endeavor is made to consider all
factors that may influence the future life of the
patient,&mdash;the length of time and the amount he
has been drinking, the effect on his character
and physical health, the surroundings and occupation
to which he must return. Some patients
are paroled at the end of six months, some remain
seven months. Drug users require treatment
for a much longer period of time than
users of liquor; and they remain from nine
months to a year. The law provides that a patient
shall not be paroled in less than two months,
nor shall he be detained longer than two years
without parole. This, of course, introduces the
disagreeable aspect of the work. The detention
is compulsory; and in some patients antagonism
possibly over-balances the benefit of detention.</p>

<p>“One of the most pronounced features of inebriety
is, however, the inability of many inebriates
to appreciate the necessity for treatment;
and the more severe the inebriety, the less easy
it is first to get the patient under treatment at
all, and, secondly, to get him to remain long
enough for any treatment to have a permanent
curative effect. One has only to work among
inebriates, no matter to what class of society
they belong, to know that fear of interfering with
the liberty of a subject who has no real liberty,
in that he is a slave habitually or periodically to
the drink craze, results in the interference with
the liberty of all those who have to put up with
his irresponsible behavior under the influence of
alcohol and other narcotic drugs.</p>

<p>“Were the treatment of the inebriate only possible
in a free sanatorium, only a small minority
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
of inebriates would come under treatment at all,
and these would be of the less severe type.”
(Pathological Inebriety, by J. W. Ashley Cooper,
1913.)</p>

<p>Discipline is of great importance, but great
care must be taken in its enforcement. It is of
more value for one to perform a certain duty because
one regards it either as the proper thing or
as likely to benefit one’s self or others.</p>

<p>The personal influence of those who come into
close contact with the inebriate can hardly be
overestimated. He is easily influenced, often
easily led, and a few thoughtless words or careless
actions can undo the result of patient work.</p>

<p>All factors that may influence the future life
of the patient must be taken into consideration,&mdash;the
length of time and amount he has been drinking,
the effect on his physical health and character,
and the surroundings and occupation to
which he must return. Very often the cause
of the commencement of the patient’s excessive
drinking may be removed or may have disappeared.
Such would favorably influence the prognosis.</p>

<p>The presence or absence of irremediable disease
is important. For instance, a woman recently
committed to our care suffered from what was
supposed to be, or was, neuralgia. She still has
occasional twinges of pain; but we believe when
the dentist has finished his work these will disappear,
and her prospect be reasonably bright.
A man, 56 years of age, four years ago, suffering
from stone in the bladder, was given morphine,
following an operation. The bladder condition
was permanently relieved, but he became a morphine
user. Such a case is a promising one. In
him the destruction of character is but little
marked.</p>

<p>A boy, chasing around the city, acquired the
cocaine habit, and became a loafer, drinker, and
follower of loose women. For him the future
offers practically no prospect. Were he a little
younger, and had the attempt to rescue him been
made earlier, there would have been much more
promise. But I doubt whether he can withstand
the lure of his former life. With a few drinks, his
judgment becomes paralyzed, and he is back to
cocaine again.</p>

<p>Another man, an alcoholic, a printer, became
nervous and exhausted after six months of linotype
work. He probably will not get over his
drinking permanently unless he changes his occupation.</p>

<p>One of the most important factors as regards
recovery is the length of time a patient remains
at the Hospital. It is sheer folly to expect that
in a few short weeks a man shall have entirely
recovered from the effect of excesses extending
over a period of years, to expect him to regain
a lost will power in that time.</p>

<p>Another important factor is the insight a patient
obtains into his own condition. We cannot
claim to make a man stop drinking. All we
can do, is to place him in such mental and physical
health that it is unnecessary for him to resort to
stimulants.</p>

<h3>RESULTS</h3>

<p>The result of treatment in a disease of the
nature of inebriety, can hardly be estimated in
such time as the Hospital has been open. Our
statistics are simply offered to show possibilities.
As the statute under which the Hospital operates,
contemplates a period of detention and treatment
for not less than two months,&mdash;and that
period is even too short in the vast majority of
cases,&mdash;anyone resident in the Hospital for less
than two months has been placed in a separate
class, and we can learn that only two of these are
doing well. Of 172 men, aside from those who
have been discharged as not proper subjects, 54
were paroled, of whom 37, or 68 per cent, are reported
as doing well, 27 were released under
bond, of whom 17, or 63 per cent, are reporting.
Over one-half of the voluntary patients are reporting.</p>

<p>Averaging all, we find 57 reporting as doing
well; 30 fail to report; 29 are escaped, and we
can learn nothing of them; and 56 were here
less than two months, 38 of these being escaped;
7 voluntary patients; and 8 were released under
bond. A percentage of abstainers of 25, is to be
regarded as most excellent; and as one-third of
those who have left here are still abstaining,
the greater number of failures occurring in the
first month, the outlook for the future is very
encouraging.</p>

<p>So far, we have been speaking of what we are
trying to do for the more hopeful class of patients.
But what are we to do in the future with
the incurable, the recidivists? Are we to send
them back into the world time and again, let
them abuse themselves, perchance their families,
and let them be, as it were, a constant menace to
society? No, society has a right to protect itself
and to protect an individual against himself.
There should be provision made for this class.
They should be cared for in an institution under
strict discipline, and made to support themselves
there and to contribute to the support of those
who may be dependent upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>As soon as considerable numbers are received
at an institution, the more apparent becomes the
need of means for classification, especially as to
character. It is decidedly unwise to allow the
intermingling of the young lad who has just commenced
to drink, with the incorrigible or the
sodden, whose every thought may lie bestial.</p>

<p>The most practical means of classification is
by the use of cottages; and it is on that plan
that Minnesota’s institution has been started. If
two cottages were built at Willmar we should
be able to make four groups of patients with
decided advantage to our inmates. Not more
than forty inmates should be cared for in each
cottage: and I am strongly in favor of separate
rooms for sleeping-quarters, instead of dormitories.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>The essential in the treatment of the inebriate
as we meet him, is upbuilding of body and character,
which requires time, and in which drugs
play only a small part.</p>

<p>Compulsory abstinence is of great value if we
expect to care for a majority of the inebriates.</p>

<p>It would be wise for the State to undertake
the custody, care and control of all non-criminal
inebriates in one institution, provided adequate
facilities for classification were available.</p>

<h3>DISCUSSION</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. C. R. Ball</span> (St. Paul): I have been very much
interested this afternoon in this symposium on the
treatment of fractures, the last word in obstetrics, and
the inebriate, only it seems to me the Program Committee
put the cart before the horse, and should have
put the inebriate first, and the other things would naturally
follow afterwards.</p>

<p>Dr. Freeman has splendidly presented his work and
results at the Willmar institution. It is a subject to
which I think medical men pay too little attention. I
have more and more come to look upon the inebriate
as a type of nervous disease and, in the great majority
of cases, a functional nervous disease. It may be classified
as we classify nervous diseases. We classify in
one way functional nervous diseases as to their cause,&mdash;acquired,
hereditary and acquired, or wholly hereditary.</p>

<p>The inebriate may be also classed in the same way.
There are perhaps a few cases in which the habit of
taking alcohol is absolutely acquired, but they are comparatively
few. There are also a few cases of nervous
prostration or functional nervous conditions from overwork,
from a depleted condition, where the nervous
condition comes on; and we may say it is acquired, and
the prognosis in both of these cases is good. It requires
but little effort to put them on their feet. Then
we have that larger class of neurasthenic or functional
nervous conditions, belonging to the second group, in
which the nervous disease, as well as the inebriety, is
partially acquired and partially hereditary. There is a
large class here. They have an unstable nervous system,
and whether they drink or break down depends
a great deal upon the environment and physical condition.
This type of inebriate must be treated along the
same broad lines that we treat a person who is a
neurasthenic, who is subject to repeated nervous breakdowns.</p>

<p>There is another type which, unfortunately, is rather
large; and this is the wholly hereditary, and in this
type we may classify the dipsomaniac. I have looked
for a long time upon dipsomania as a periodical
nervous disturbance, similar to periodical attacks of
migraine or epilepsy, or periodical attacks of insanity.
Often where a son is an inebriate we find a history of
migraine in the mother. Very often there is insanity,
and very often there is epilepsy, so that when we come
to consider the dipsomaniac we have a tremendous
problem. He does not drink for the fun of it, but
chiefly because of mental depression, mental restlessness,
which is so great that he turns to alcohol to buoy
up his spirits and get rid of the feeling which rather
than suffer with, he would often prefer to die. I have
a man of that description who came to me, and said
that at a certain time he became depressed and suspicious,
began to hate himself, went along the back
streets, absented himself from his usual associates, and
always did this at the beginning of his drinking bout.
That is the case with all dipsomaniacs. It is a disease
similar to epilepsy, and our success in treating this
type is just about as good as in treating epilepsy. It is
not the alcohol: it is an inherited condition; it is a
periodical nervous disturbance, just as epilepsy and
migraine are.</p>

<p>We hear a great deal about the prevention of tuberculosis,
and much is done to prevent it. I think we
hear much more about the evil effects of syphilis than
of alcohol, but, in my experience, I would place alcohol
at the top of the list as being the most damaging both
to the individual himself and to his offspring. We
have heard a great deal about the effect on the offspring.
In my clinic at the Free Dispensary I have
many epileptic children, and I should say in sixty per
cent of the cases one parent is an alcoholic. An address
of Dr. Rogers, of Faribault, with reference to
the ill effects of one intoxication, when a conception
occurs during that time, put the subject of drinking
before me in a new light. Much interesting experimentation
has within recent years been done with rabbits
and guinea-pigs to show the harmful effect of a
single dose of alcohol given to either the male or
female parent before conception, on the after-coming
litter.</p>

<p>Not long ago I read an article by some man in New
York in which he stated he had traced seven cases of
epilepsy to the evil results of a single intoxication in
seven different parents. That was something rather
new to me, as I thought, in order to get the bad effects,
on the descendants, of alcohol, it was necessary to
be a chronic alcoholic, and I believe very few of the
laity understand that, if conception happens to occur
during one drunk, the parent being otherwise a temperate
person, the ill effects may be visited on the offspring
to as great an extent as if the parent were a
chronic inebriate. These are some of the things which
would do good if given publicity.</p>

<p>In regard to the treatment: I can fully agree with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
Dr. Freeman in everything he has said. There is certainly
no specific when you come to consider the nature
of the trouble. The treatment must be carried along
the same general lines of physical and moral upbuilding
as those we seek to follow in functional nervous
disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. W. A. Jones</span> (Minneapolis): I wonder how
many members of the State Association have visited
the hospital for inebriates at Willmar. I would like
to ask all those who have, to hold up their hands. Five
or six of this audience, representing the twelve hundred
doctors belonging to this Association. That gives one
a fair estimate of those familiar with the State farm
for inebriates. I should like to know further how
many members of the legislature have visited this institution,
and how many have tried to condemn it or
perhaps to take it for a tuberculosis hospital. That is
what they will do unless we physicians stand by Dr.
Freeman and the institution.</p>

<p>There is too much sentiment, too much sympathy
among friends, relatives, courts, juries, and charity
workers, as to the inebriate; but once he gets to Willmar
and is under a proper regimen, his attitude changes
totally toward himself and toward the world. After
one has watched the treatment at Willmar and has seen
the benefit these patients derive, he wonders why so
many women and so many men are sent to quack institutions
for inebriety and drug habits. Willmar costs
the patient practically nothing, except a small per
capita borne by the State. The average quack institution
charges $150.00 for a cure, so called, whether the
cure lasts for three days, or, as in some of the more conservative
(?) quack institutions, the period is extended
to ten days, and in the notoriously drink-habit cures,
to thirty days. This ought to appeal to a doctor forcibly,
inasmuch as all these claims of cures made by quack
institutions are limited to thirty days at the outside, an
absolutely absurd statement, and, for that reason, if
for none other, we should all support and entertain
anything that tends to increase the efficiency of the
State farm for inebriates at Willmar.</p>

<p>One thing which Dr. Freeman wants to emphasize
is the necessity at times of forcible restraint in a building
especially constructed for detention cases. There
is a small class of people who are, perhaps, suffering
from a disease state, who are irresponsible. Most of
them are common drunkards, who create all sorts of
disturbances and who really need discipline&mdash;who need
to be detained forcibly for a sufficient length of time
to enable them to recover their normal physical tone,
and until they recover something of their natural
mental tone. If this could be incorporated in the rules
and regulations of the governing body of the inebriate
farm it would make a great increase in the total number
of improvements and recoveries.</p>

<p>Dr. Freeman has emphasized the necessity of getting
the physical condition up to a high point. He has said
all that is really needed on the subject. I believe drugs
and drink should be reduced rapidly in almost every
case. If you look over some of the literature of some
institutions that take these people, you will find they
reduce the morphine down from fifty grains to forty,
and then to thirty-nine, until, finally, after a period of
so many weeks or months, they cut it down to the
two-hundredth of a grain, and give it hypodermically.
You can readily see the absurdity of that treatment.
The average man can have the total reduction made
within thirty-six or forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>I hope you will take more interest in the inebriate
farm, and see that your legislator is interested as well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Haldor Sneve</span> (St. Paul): I have listened with
a great deal of pleasure to Dr. Freeman’s paper, and
especially because there are some statistics as to what
can be accomplished in such an institution even in a
comparatively short time. Personally, I think that six
months as an average time to stay in this institution
would be too short. It will be found, however, in time,
whether this is true, but just now the institution is in
the experimental trial stage.</p>

<p>A great many legislators are, as Dr. Jones said, trying
to convert this institution either into an insane
asylum or a tuberculosis sanatorium; and it is up to
the profession of the state to back up the establishment
of this institution for the treatment of a class
which is growing.</p>

<p>Personally, I think drink is a vice and not a disease,
and until we can eradicate from the minds of the laity
and from the minds of some physicians the idea that a
man who drinks is some sort of a nervous invalid, the
sooner we shall get better results in the handling of
this question. Even the dipsomaniac has periodic
brain-storms, which Dr. Ball has likened to attacks of
migraine; that is a good simile, they do not always
take to drink, but go off in other ways.</p>

<p>I have treated from twenty to fifty cases of delirium
tremens at the City Hospital every year for twenty
years, and I have had considerable experience in institutions;
and yet I cannot find anything to criticize
about the principles of treatment that Dr. Freeman has
put forth here today. The idea in the minds of the
laity is that inebriety is a disease, and they want drugs
for it to make them well, and that is one reason why
so many patients go to Keeley cures and get well. They
go there because they find a drug that cures <i>disease</i>.
I find that the Towne-Lambert treatment is an excellent
<i>mental</i> treatment for the inebriate in private practice.
It can be used in the institution at Willmar, as
well as in private practice, and putting a patient upon
the Towne-Lambert treatment satisfies his desire to
cure the disease he is suffering from.</p>

<p>I think the profession will have to keep their eyes
on the legislators, perhaps on the new governor, and
see that this institution is not thrown into the waste-basket,
so to speak, or converted into some other sort
of institution, because we need a place of this kind.
Even if Minnesota can go prohibition pretty soon&mdash;and
I rather think it will&mdash;we shall not get rid of our
drunkards for that reason. We shall still have to
have a hospital for the treatment of the morphine,
cocaine, and alcoholic habits. The doctors who send
patients to Willmar, I think, ought to be careful, and
not try to help some municipality out of taking care
of old battered hulks, who cannot hope to recover, who
cannot be made well simply because they have been
drinking for so many years, and their other habits of
life have resulted in such a deterioration of the brain
that there is no possibility of bringing them back and
making really good citizens of them. Those patients
should be kept in a work-house or in a special department
at Willmar or some other place. We should try
to reclaim all of our young men and young women
habitues.</p>

<p>Owing to the absence of proper writeups about this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
hospital it is not generally known throughout the state
that pay-patients can be received and treated just as
in any sanitarium and at very moderate rates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Freeman</span> (closing): I really have nothing to add
in closing except to say a word with regard to prohibition.
I have a second-hand statement from the police
of one of the Twin Cities that he is positive in his city
there are five thousand drug-users from his experience in
the police court.</p>

<p>With regard to the maintenance of discipline at the institution:
We have sufficient law or authority for discipline,
but we have not the facilities. The thing in my
opinion that we mostly require is a building where
we can take care of a man who is incorrigible, or a man
who runs away. For two reasons: In the first place, I
have known a number of men who came there unwillingly,
who later were greatly benefited by their compulsory
stay; second, the effect of disciplinary measures
upon the population in general. If a man knows that,
when he goes there, he must stay, he naturally gets over
his constant thought that he is going to sneak away, and
put it over. The custodial cottage to take care of forty
people would allow, in all, four classes of patients. We
should have a reception-ward in which to examine all
new patients; one ward for the incorrigible; and we
should have two other places to care for two classes of
men received. This would prevent the influence of the
older men who have gone further in their habits upon
the young boy who has just started.</p>

DIAGNOSIS OF INTRACRANIAL COMPLICATIONS IN DISEASES
OF THE MIDDLE EAR AND ACCESSORY
SINUSES OF THE NOSE
<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Joseph C. Beck</span>, M. D.<br />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a>
Read before the Sioux Valley Medical Association,
July 22, 1914, and published in these columns at the
request of the Association.</p>

</div>

<p>The most important causes of intracranial
complication from the middle ear and nasal accessory
sinuses, are suppurations, consequently
I shall confine my remarks to that subject, and
not take up the neoplasms, trauma, etc.</p>

<p>In the diagnosis it is most important to recognize
suppurative disease of the ear and sinuses,
but this subject is not within the province of
this paper, therefore I shall satisfy myself by
mentioning only that the presence of the pus
from the middle ear and nose, and Röntgenographic
examination, are the most important
signs of affections of these structures. The one
symptom more than any other on the part of
the patient of a threatening extension into the
cranial cavity, is localized pain or headache,
which is very persistent, instead of periodic.
Especially important is this in connection with
the cessation or diminution of the discharge.
The knowledge of the pathological change present
in the sinuses and middle ear and mastoid, is
of additional value as, for instance, tuberculosis,
syphilis, and cholesteatoma.</p>

<p>The frequency of intracranial complication in
suppuration of the middle ear is much greater
than that following sinus disease, about twenty-five
to one in my experience.</p>

<p>The intracranial complications which I shall
consider are&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li>Meningitis.</li>
<li>Sinus thrombosis.</li>
<li>Brain abscess.</li>
</ol>

<p>The meningitis may be serous or suppurative,
and later localized or diffuse.</p>

<p>The sinus thrombosis may be partial or parietal,
and complete with or without involvement
of the jugular bulb and vein. The brain abscess
may be extradural or genuine within the brain
substance proper. The complications may be
further divided as to bacteriologic or etiologic
factors as, for instance&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Streptococcic</li>
<li>Staphylococcic</li>
<li>Pneumococcic</li>
<li>Tuberculous</li>
<li>Syphilitic</li>
</ul>

<p>These complications may arise following
acute, or chronic and acute, exacerbation of
chronic suppuration of the ear and sinuses. Meningitis
and sinus thrombosis (this latter condition
is very frequently associated with a localized
meningitis) are usually complications following
acute, or acute exacerbation of chronic,
suppuration of the ear and sinuses. Brain abscess,
however, is most frequently associated with the
chronic form of the ear and sinus disease; but
these become more manifest following an acute
attack of ear or sinus trouble. Tubercular or
syphilitic meningitis is chronic inflammation
<i>per se</i>; but these conditions are also lit up by
the acute processes within the ear and sinuses.</p>

<p>The cardinal symptoms of any intracranial
complications are&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. <i>Pain or headache.</i>&mdash;This may be localized
or diffuse; it is, however, very persistent and
quite intense. It is in the recognition of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
symptom that has helped me more than any
other in suspecting intracranial trouble.</p>

<p>2. <i>Nausea and vomiting.</i>&mdash;This symptom is
quite constant, especially early in the disease;
and projectile vomiting is quite characteristic of
intracranial pressure or irritation.</p>

<p>3. <i>General septic appearance.</i>&mdash;This of course
will vary in the different conditions under consideration,
but in all is it quite manifest.</p>

<p>4. <i>The vision</i> is very frequently affected due
to the choked disk that is present.</p>

<p>5. <i>Temperature, pulse, and respiration</i> are
very frequently disturbed.</p>

<p>6. <i>Definite focal symptoms</i> of brain localization
are of the utmost importance in the diagnosis.</p>

<p>7. <i>Blood and spinal fluid examinations</i> give
very valuable information.</p>

<p>8. <i>Röntgenographic findings</i> are at times valuable.</p>

<p>9. <i>Exploratory operation and treatment</i>, as
in lues, is at times necessary to make a diagnosis.</p>

</div>

<h3>MENINGITIS</h3>

<p>(a) <i>Serous meningitis.</i>&mdash;One of the first
signs is the increasing headache, at first localized,
usually near the seat of the perforation or
path of infection, and soon becoming diffuse
over the head. The patient loses his appetite, his
tongue becomes coated, the emunctaries become
sluggish in their action, and nausea is a very
common symptom. The temperature rises, and,
if the septic form is going to follow, this rise is
often quite rapid, so that there may occur small
chills from the infection of the cerebrospinal
fluid. The pulse and respiration rate is now considerably
increased. The patient is very irritable
and restless, and does not sleep. As soon as the
fluid increases within the cavity there is observed
the characteristic syndrome of rolling the eyes,
especially upward, the neck is drawn backwards,
and finally the leg upon the thigh and
thigh upon the abdomen. Attempts to straighten
them out is resisted and appears to be painful,&mdash;Kernig’s
sign.</p>

<p>Stroking the bottom of the feet with some
semisharp instrument or the finger-nail will
cause the big toe to turn up instead of down,&mdash;Babinski’s
sign.</p>

<p>Taking the head and tilting it forward against
the chest will cause the limbs to be drawn up,&mdash;Brudzinski’s
sign.</p>

<p>All the other symptoms, as pressing over the
peroneal nerve and muscle (Gordon’s sign),
which will cause the extension of the toes, the
stroking of the anterior tibial surface (Oppenheim’s
sign), or the stroking of the region of the
external malleolus (Chaddock’s sign), will produce
retraction of the toes. All these signs, I
say, prove that the upper neuron (within the
cranium) is involved. The patient now will
lapse into unconsciousness, and be roused with
more or less difficulty to again relapse in the
same condition. The pupils become sluggish in
their action, at first becoming small, then irregular,
and finally dilated.</p>

<p>Ophthalmoscopic examination may reveal a
choked disk. Spinal puncture shows increased
pressure by fluid very frequently coming through
the hollow needle with a spurt, and clear or slightly
cloudy. Following such a puncture the patient
is very often much improved for from a half an
hour to a whole day, but the symptoms soon return.
A complete examination of the cerebrospinal
fluid thus removed, will aid a great deal
in diagnosis. This includes the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Remove about 25 c. c. at spinal puncture.</p>

<p>2. Make several slides and stains for organisms,
as septic and tubercular.</p>

<p>3. Examine and count the endothelial cells,
leucocytes, and pus cells.</p>

<p>4. Make cultures.</p>

<p>5. Make a Noguchi (butyric-acid) test for
excess of albumin.</p>

<p>6. Make a Lange colloidial test.</p>

<p>7. Wassermann, Nonne, and Noguchi tests
for syphilis.</p>

<p>8. Test for sugar.</p>

<p>9. Test for total acidity and relative acidity.</p>

<p>10. Cholin may be tested for.</p>
</div>

<p>In the serous form one will find the cells increased
somewhat, especially the leucocytes, but
the micro-organisms are conspicuous by their
absence.</p>

<p>The Lange (colloidal-goldchloride) test will
show the characteristic color reaction of a septic
process.</p>

<p>The Noguchi (butyric-acid) test will be positive.
Excess of albumin.</p>

<p>The Wassermann, Nonne and Noguchi tests
for syphilis are negative. (Unless such a case
should be a complicated one.)</p>

<p>The test for sugar is very important in that in
serous meningitis sugar is present.</p>

<p>The relative acidity is not markedly affected,
and cholin is not present, or, if so, in only small
quantity.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Septic meningitis.</i>&mdash;If this is <i>localized</i>,
and there is a collateral serous meningitis associated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
with it, then the symptoms may be the
same, as just described; however, the cerebrospinal
fluid will show a greater degree of irritation,
and the fluid may contain some micro-organisms.
The majority of localized septic
meningitis cases, however, are not as severe in
their course as the serous or diffuse septic forms.
The one important symptom is the localized
headache, which is quite persistent, and the
greater rise in the temperature. There are, undoubtedly,
many cases of localized meningitis
that show a perfectly normal cerebrospinal fluid,
and most of the cardinal symptoms absent; and
these are the cases that usually get well or lead
to extradural abscesses subsequently.</p>

<p>The <i>diffuse septic meningitis</i> is the most discouraging
intracranial complication that we have
to deal with, and the diagnosis as a rule is not
difficult. It usually is preceded by the serous
form, but within a very short time develops the
graver symptoms of sepsis. The most positive
symptom is the spinal puncture. The fluid comes
out under pressure, but not so great as in the
serous form, and is turbid. The turbidity varies
in degree with the amount of infection. It has the
appearance at times of pure pus; in fact, that is
what it is. Bacteriologically one will find many
micro-organisms of the character of the infection;
and leucocytes or pus cells are very numerous.</p>

<p>The sugar reaction is always absent, and the
acidity is much increased as is the quantity of
cholin.</p>

<p>The pressure or irritative symptoms as the
Kernig and Babinski tests, as well as the pupillary
reactions, are practically the same as in the
serous meningitis, only that they soon give away
to the paralytic form, namely: pupils dilate,
patient is in a constant stupor or coma, and the
involuntary urination and bowel movements become
very manifest. The patient is, as a rule,
unable to take or be given nourishment. The
outcome is, in my experience, with one exception,
always fatal, due to diffuse cerebritis. I
have had a case of diffuse septic meningitis in
the early stages of a pneumococcic type which I
operated on by the Haynes’ method of drainage
of the cyscterna magna, and which recovered;
and I believe that the success in that case was due
to the very early intervention, because I have
operated by the same method on eight other cases
more advanced and of streptococcic and staphylococcic
type of infection, which ended fatally.</p>

<p><i>Sinus thrombosis.</i>&mdash;This complication is the
one that is recognized as giving the best prognosis
because it can be very readily recognized,
and even exploration is warranted to make such
diagnosis. It most frequently follows, or is associated
with, acute infections of the middle ear
and mastoid process. The most important symptoms
are the chills and fever of a distinct septic
type, and, as a rule, increasing in frequency.
There is invariably a blood-picture of sepsis,
namely, a very high leucocyte count and the
polymorphonuclear type in marked excess.
Blood cultures are, as a rule, positive of a bacteriemia.
If the process has extended to the bulb
and internal jugular vein, then one may feel a
thickening or cord-like mass along the anterior
border of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle. The
fundus examination often reveals a choked disk,
especially on the side where the thrombosis is
located. A symptom recently described by Beck,
of Vienna, and Crowe, of Baltimore, and proven
by me to be of positive value in several cases, is
the production or increase of a choked disk by
compression of the healthy internal jugular vein.
Urbanschitch has shown in quite a number of
cases of sinus thrombosis that the blood-clotting
time is very much enhanced. This of course is
true of any case of bacteriemia or septic phlebitis
anywhere in the body. I have proven this test to
be of value to me in several cases of sinus thrombosis.
The exploratory exposure of the lateral
sinus is of distinct value, and the only fact to
remember is to expose a sufficient area so that
one is able to deal with the sinus in case it be
opened accidentally, because such an accident
when this precaution was not taken has led to
serious consequences.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of a thrombotic sinus when
exposed is made first by its discoloration, usually
of a grayish pink; secondly, it feels harder than
normal and is not resilient when compressed,
that is, it does not spring back. It, however, may
be soft in case the thrombus has broken down;
and in cases of parietal thrombosis it may spring
back because there is blood circulating through it.
One will at times find a small collection of pus
about the sinus, a condition known as perisinus
abscess, and in many instances of this condition
the sinus itself is not thrombosed. The puncture
of the sinus by a hypodermic needle and attempt
to withdraw some blood, is not at present considered
good practice owing to the danger of infecting
a non-infected sinus. An incision is considered
a wiser plan, and subsequently packing both
sides (torcular and bulb) so they are shut off
from the general circulation. There are many
instances of secondary infection by embolism,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
either in or about the joints, and infection into
the lungs, spleen, pancreas, etc., with the entire
train of symptoms from such complications.</p>

<p><i>Brain Abscess.</i>&mdash;This is most frequently associated
with chronic suppuration of the middle ear
and mastoid, and labyrinthine disease. As stated
before, we must consider two principal types,
namely, those outside the dura and those within.
They may exist at the same time, or the intradural
abscess may frequently follow, especially in
acute exacerbations, the extradural abscess.
The paramount symptom is the great pain in
the head, most frequently localized at or in close
proximity to the abscess. I have, however,
found several instances where the patient located
the pain in the anterior portion of the head, and
operation or post-mortem examination disclosed
it in the posterior cerebral fossa. This pain is
not at all unlike that in brain tumor, and there
are exacerbations in the headaches sometimes
at night, other times in the mornings, and in one
of my cases the patient would have about ten attacks
of severe head-pains within twenty-four
hours, and in the intervals be fairly comfortable.</p>

<p>The next group of symptoms of importance
are the focal lesions, which will correspond to
the anatomicophysiologic locations and actions.
These focal symptoms will vary in degree in that
they be either irritative or destructive. So, for
instance, a small abscess pressing over the motor
area will cause clonic contraction and a still
larger abscess, especially if it be intradural, will
produce paralysis of that portion of the body
governed by that particular area. Again, if it
be located in the cerebellar region it will cause
a train of symptoms of imbalance and loss of interpretation
of direction, which must be carefully
differentiated from the irritation of the
labyrinth. In this department there has been
much work done by Barany, Ruttin, Neumann,
and other Viennese, and many others to make it
possible to make a differential diagnosis; and
there is a great deal more to be done. One of the
most important recent contributions in this regard
is the “pointing test” of Barany in connection
with cerebellar lesions; and careful
study and experimenting at every opportunity is
very much recommended, in order to familiarize
one’s self with this test. This in connection
with the various labyrinth tests makes the differential
diagnosis much more easy. One must remember
that both labyrinthian irritation in connection
with suppuration of the ear and cerebellar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
irritation from brain abscess may exist at the
same time.</p>

<p><i>Intracranial pressure</i>, being increased in brain
abscess, will cause the cerebrospinal fluid to be
increased and found to be so by spinal puncture,
although no pus cells or micro-organisms will
be found, unless there is also a concomitant
diffuse septic meningitis or ventricular infection
present. The ocular symptoms of intracranial
pressure, such as pupillary (often one large and
one small) and choked disk, are usually present.
The <i>pulse rate</i> and <i>respiration</i> will be affected,
as in brain tumor, according to the size of the
abscess. The larger the abscess the slower the
pulse and respiration. The temperature, as well
as the pulse and respiration, will vary as to
whether the abscess be intradural or extradural.
Intradural abscesses will frequently cause considerable
rise of temperature, and acceleration
of the pulse and respiration, and a remission
when the abscess has become partially walled
off. As soon as a fresh invasion of brain tissue
takes place another rise of temperature, etc.,
occurs.</p>

<p><i>Projectile vomiting</i> is, as in brain tumor, quite
frequently encountered.</p>

<p><i>The Röntgenogram</i>, especially a stereoscopic
one, will be of some value in cases where through
its chronicity a change of bone by pressure has
taken place, or if one may follow the path of
necrosis from the nasal accessory sinuses or the
middle ear and mastoid process towards the
brain. I will state, however, as I have stated on
several occasions before, that not too much emphasis
should be laid on the diagnostic value of
the <i>x</i>-ray in intracranial lesions, especially
abscess. I have been disappointed in this great
method of diagnosis (<i>x</i>-ray) and much annoyed
at the positiveness of some observers without
sufficient evidence.</p>

<p>As in sinus thrombosis, so in brain abscess
one should not hesitate in the exploratory operation,
because waiting too long will often reduce
the patient’s ability to stand an operation later
on. Should one not find the abscess, then the
decompression has done a great deal to prevent
destruction of brain tissue by pressure, besides
the patient will be very much relieved of the
severe head-pains. This may be said also of
spinal punctures. In this way one may wait for
development of localization for another operation.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would like to repeat the words
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
of Prof. Neumann as to the differential diagnosis
between meningitis, sinus thrombosis, and
brain abscess: “A patient that has meningitis
is one that wishes to be left alone and allowed
to sleep, although when roused is not particularly
irritable. If he has brain abscess then he
is constantly very irritable and difficult to manage,
while a patient that has sinus thrombosis
when he is free from the chill and fever is very
pleasant, apparently well.”</p>

THE TREATMENT OF GONORRHEAL OPHTHALMIA</h2>

MINNEAPOLIS</p>

<p>In ophthalmology, as in other branches of
medical science, the advance in therapeutics has
hardly kept pace, in recent years, with that in
pathology and diagnosis. Comparatively few of
the therapeutic innovations of the past decade
have stood the test of time; and, in the main,
the ophthalmological materia medica of today
bears a striking resemblance to that of fifteen
or twenty years ago. Our poverty of therapeutic
resource has been notably exemplified in the
generally accepted method of treatment of gonorrheal
ophthalmia; and the results obtained with
the conventional treatment as outlined in the
current text-books are far from satisfactory.</p>

<p>Gonorrheal ophthalmia, in both infants and
adults, continues to cause an appalling amount
of blindness; and only a part of this can, with
justice, be ascribed to ignorance and neglect.
The number of cases which, in spite of the
most careful treatment, go on to corneal ulcer,
perforation, panophthalmitis, and irreparable
blindness, continues to be considerable. Further,
a decided difference of opinion still exists among
well-trained oculists of wide experience as to the
best method of handling these cases. For over
a hundred years silver nitrate has enjoyed an unquestioned
pre-eminence in the treatment of the
purulent ophthalmias, particularly those cases in
which the gonococcus was the etiological factor;
and even now to question its right to a place in
the treatment of gonorrheal conjunctivitis seems
to many to be as heretical as to abandon mercury
in the treatment of syphilis. For many years the
only difference of opinion in regard to silver nitrate
seemed to be as to whether it should be employed
in the first stage of the disease, or whether
one should wait until the discharge became purulent.
Of late years, however, a number of experienced
oculists have gone on record as being
of the opinion that the majority of these cases
do distinctly better without the nitrate than with
it. As is well known, the nitrate destroys only
those gonococci lying upon the surface or in the
most superficial layers of the conjunctiva; and,
far from reaching those in the deeper layers,
rather forms a film over the surface which protects
them from the irrigating solution used later.
It also appears to be certain that the use of the
nitrate, for a time at least, increases the ratio of
extra-to intracellular gonococci in the discharge,
which furnishes another valid argument against
its use. That a subsequent chronic conjunctivitis
with hypertrophy is often a disagreeable sequel in
cases in which an energetic course of silver nitrate
has been used is a matter of common observation.
The vogue of certain of the organic
silver salts, such as argyrol, protargol, etc., is no
doubt, not so much due to any intrinsic therapeutic
merit which they possess as to the fact that
the average case gets along better without the
local application of strong chemical antiseptics.
However one may feel about the abandoning of
such a time-honored drug as the nitrate of silver
in the treatment of this disease, it must be conceded
that it is entirely inadequate to control the
process in the severer cases, and as a therapeutic
sheet-anchor leaves a great deal to be desired.</p>

<p>The use of cold compresses in gonorrheal
ophthalmia continues to be advocated in text-books
and practiced in many clinics, especially in
America, in spite of the fact that the progressive
men in general medicine and surgery seem pretty
generally to have abandoned the use of cold applications
in the treatment of acute inflammations
of bacterial origin. Any merit the cold
compresses may have in the reducing of the edema
and relieving pain are more than counterbalanced
by the fact that the vitality of the tissues is
at the same time lowered. In cases in which
there is a sufficient swelling of the lids to cause
a dangerous pressure on the eyeball, cold should
not for a moment be depended upon to control
the inflammatory edema but instant recourse had
to canthotomy: in cases where this swelling is not
marked cold compresses are unnecessary and
apart from a certain analgesic effect, of no value.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
The skepticism, which is becoming more general,
in regard to the value of silver nitrate and cold
applications has not extended to the third member
of the classic trinity,&mdash;irrigations,&mdash;the efficacy
of which seems to be generally conceded.
Various substances have been advocated for this
purpose,&mdash;boric acid, potassium permanganate,
bichloride of mercury, normal salt solution, etc.,
and the consensus of opinion seems to be that it
is practically indifferent which one of these is
used, the action being mechanical rather than
chemical. The ordinary method of half-hourly
irrigations has been abandoned by Hosford,
Ulbrich, and others in favor of the constant irrigation
with the Hosford apparatus or some
modification of it.</p>

<p>The English adherents of the constant irrigation
treatment, who, for the most part, dispense
with the use of silver nitrate altogether, report
excellent results; but the method is not without
its drawbacks. The apparatus is awkward to
use, requires as much or more attention than the
intermittent irrigations, and undoubtedly disturbs
the rest of the patient at night more. Further,
since the lids are, of course, not held apart
for the constant irrigation, but the flow of the
solution across the palpebral fissure is depended
on to cleanse the eye of secretion, one is inclined
to question whether the mechanical cleansing is
as thorough as when the lids are gently held apart
while the eye is being irrigated.</p>

<p>The more one sees of these cases, the more one
is impressed with two things: first, that a certain
percentage of them would make a complete and
uncomplicated recovery, even if they were entirely
untreated (undoubtedly this number is
larger than we think, especially in children);
second, that the usual treatment is entirely inadequate
in those cases in which there is an
especially virulent infection or a lowered resistance
of the tissues. When antigonococcic serum
was first developed and its action observed in
cases of acute gonorrheal ophthalmia, the results
were, as in acute urethritis, disappointing.
Many oculists are of the opinion that the serum
is entirely without value in acute blenorrhea,
even though its use be indicated in metastatic
eye disease of gonorrheal origin. Of late, however,
at least two men in America have written
enthusiastically of serum-therapy in acute gonorrheal
conjunctivitis, advocating its employment
in the usual manner and also its use locally, i.e.,
dropped into the conjunctival sac in place of the
usual antiseptics. It would seem that the data
now available hardly warrant a positive statement
in regard to the serum-therapy.</p>

<p>The pathological findings in gonorrheal ophthalmia
are simple but significant, in that the
gonococcus of Neisser is found, not only on the
surface and in the superficial cells of the conjunctiva,
but also, often within forty-eight hours, has
invaded the deeper layers of the epithelium and
the subepithelial connective tissue. This at once
makes clear the reason for the inefficacy of the
local antiseptics, particularly those like silver
nitrate, the action of which is very superficial.
Organic silver preparations and irrigations of various
kinds are equally powerless to reach any but
the most superficially situated of the bacteria.</p>

<p>Since the destruction of the bacteria lying on
the surface is not sufficient to control the disease,
it may be stated that the problem of the destruction
or inhibition of the deep-lying bacteria is the
essential problem in curing gonorrheal ophthalmia.</p>

<p>The gonococcus numbers among its biological
peculiarities an unusual intolerance of extremes
of temperature, its growth in culture being
inhibited by temperature above 38° C. or
below 18° C. Text-books on bacteriology state
that exposure to a temperature of 60° C. for a
period of ten minutes destroys the gonococcus.
Experimentation in the laboratory of the Dimmer
Clinic in Vienna in April and May, 1913, with
cultures from forty-two cases of acute gonorrheal
urethritis, seemed to indicate that this point may
be placed from one and one-half to two degrees
lower than this, i.e.,&mdash;from 58° C. to 58.5° C.</p>

<p>Thus, theoretically, at least, it would appear
that, if the conjunctiva could be subjected to a
temperature as near as possible to this without
injury to the tissues, a marked effect should be
observed in the course of the disease, particularly
if the heat can be applied in such a way as to
penetrate as deeply into the tissues as does the
gonococcus. This theoretical requirement has, in
my opinion, been perfectly met practically by the
local use of steam as practiced in the Dimmer
Clinic since February, 1913, with the apparatus
devised by Lauber and modified by the writer.
Goldzieher of Vienna was probably the first to
employ steam in the treatment of the purulent
ophthalmias; and in his first series of cases reported
fifteen patients treated with the application
of steam passing through a nozzle held at a
distance of about four centimeters from the eye,
the temperature of the steam striking the tissues
being about 45° C. (113° F.). Although the results
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
indicated that the method was a distinct
step in advance there were still a number of important
details to be worked out, in order to get
the best possible results. First of all, experiment
showed that the temperature of the steam at a
given distance from the nozzle was not constant,
so that an arbitrary distance could not be set.
This suggested the advisability of providing the
apparatus with a sliding-guard, which could be
set at the exact distance from the nozzle where
the steam was shown by the thermometer to be
at the desired temperature. Secondly, it was determined
that the tissues would sustain without
injury a considerably higher temperature than
that set by Goldzieher, and that the effect upon
the diseased process was markedly better when
the temperature was raised. Steam at from 50° C.
to 53° C. gave the best results; and in one case in
which a temperature of 55° C. was inadvertently
reached no injury was done the tissues. Further
experience naturally suggested other changes in
the original technic. In the first place, the lids
were held apart by an assistant in the usual
manner; but, even with gloves on, the exposure
of the fingers to the steam was more or less
painful, and gauze wound on little sticks was
substituted. The time of exposure was finally
set at six minutes; and since the application of
the steam could not be borne for longer than from
forty-five to sixty seconds without severe pain it
usually took twenty minutes or so to complete
the six-minute exposure. This was done once
every twenty-four hours, and was combined with
half-hourly irrigations with potassium-permanganate
solution. No other treatment was used.
The results attained with this method in 34 cases
(7 adults, 2 children and 25 infants) has left
nothing to be desired. In no case has there been
any corneal complication; swelling and pain subsided
with unusual promptness; and the course
of the disease was notably shortened, whereas,
after the first application of silver nitrate a
considerable increase in the number of gonococci
in the discharge is often observed. A striking
diminution in the number is noted after the initial
application of the steam. In 8 of the cases in
the series mentioned (all infants), the disease affected
both eyes; and in 5 of these cases the experiment
was made of treating one eye with
steam in the manner described and the other
with applications of silver nitrate in the usual
manner, using the permanganate irrigations in
both. The difference in the results attained was
very striking. In every instance the eye in which
the steam was used was brought much more
quickly under control than the one under nitrate.
In cases brought under treatment early the
edema of the lids did not become severe; and the
course of the disease seemed, in general, to be
shortened by about one-third. There were no
corneal complications, except in one case in which
there was a corneal ulcer present when the man
presented himself at the clinic. In no case was
canthotomy necessary; and no case was followed
by a chronic hypertrophic conjunctivitis. The
application of the steam is undeniably painful, but
not unbearably so.</p>

VAGINAL HYSTERECTOMY UNDER SPINAL ANESTHESIA:
REPORT ON A CASE</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">
By R. R. Cranmer</span>, M. D.<br />
MINNEAPOLIS</p>

<p>I wish to report this case of vaginal hysterectomy
under spinal anesthesia on a patient whose
age and physical condition were not favorable
for the use of ether or chloroform. The case
belonged to that comparatively small class in
which a general anesthetic cannot be used; and
it was because of this fact that spinal anesthesia
was resorted to. Had it not been necessary
for this patient to earn a livelihood by hard
labor the operation would not have been done;
but, in her case, it was necessary, and the condition
of prolapse, therefore, was a source of continual
pain and trouble. The fact that the diet
was not restricted after the operation assisted
greatly in shortening her stay in bed and her
rapid recovery.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Patient, aged 59, married, mother of six children. She
had been suffering from prolapsus uteri of a severe
degree for five years. The cervix presented at the
vaginal orifice at times. Mitral insufficiency and arteriosclerosis
were present. She also had chronic bronchitis
and a mild nephritis. Chloroform and ether being
contra-indicated, spinal anesthesia was used, two
drachms of 2 per cent novocaine solution being injected
through the fourth lumbar interspace. The vagina
was prepared for operation, and the hysterectomy
started within four minutes after the spinal injection.
The patient did not complain of any pain; and there
was no shock or other untoward symptoms. She was
immediately put upon a general diet and was able to
leave the hospital on the twelfth day.</p>

<h3 id="NEW_REMEDY">A NEW REMEDY FOR PYORRHEA
ALVEOLARIS</h3>

<p>Diseased teeth and gums have an undoubted
and pernicious effect upon the general health of
the individual. This condition as a cause of
disease has been the subject of many papers
written by physicians and dentists.</p>

<p>Now a new remedy has been proposed by Bass
and Johns which promises relief in the majority
of cases. Emetin is the drug that destroys the
ameba of pyorrhea just as ipecac destroys the
ameba of dysentery. The lesion should be attacked
persistently until healed and the use of
emetin continued to prevent reinfection.</p>

<p>Emetin may be used hypodermically in one-half
grain doses for at least three days and as
often as is necessary to destroy the ameba.</p>

<p>The presence of the ameba can be determined
only by proper microscopic examinations. The
healing process may require considerable time,
according to the extent and character of the
necrosis. Deep pockets require careful cleansing
to clear the pus-forming cavities. After this has
been accomplished and pus ceases to form Bass
and Johns recommend the use of fluid extract
of ipecac as a local application to prevent reinfection.
Ipecac will actually destroy the ameba
if used persistently and is preferable to the many
commercial preparations now in use. The teeth
should be brushed in the ordinary way, after
which one drop of fluid extract of ipecac should
be applied to the wet brush, forcing some of
the solution between the teeth and spitting out
the excess without further washing of the mouth.</p>

<p>The investigators have found that this simple
procedure will keep the mouth free from pyorrhea.
It stands to reason, however, that the teeth
must be thoroughly cleaned in the usual manner
by the dentist, otherwise it will be impossible for
the emetin or ipecac to penetrate the deep crusts
which are found about old and uncared for
mouths. It is remarkable how many people neglect
the care of their teeth and it is equally
strange that so little constitutional disorder is
found in those who neglect an ordinary and
simple sanitary toilet requisite. One of the first
rules for hospital patients when they come under
the supervision of the nurse is the provision of a
tooth brush and a suitable mouth wash.</p>

<p>Many patients from the country, a lesser number
from the cities, never employ a tooth brush.
Some even resent a suggestion of clean teeth.
Nature gave them teeth and nature is supposed
to keep them in order, but unclean teeth are the
rule rather than the exception in hospital practice.</p>

<p>Not infrequently animals need the services of
a dentist, but their numbers are few compared to
man. When a simple remedy for pyorrhea,
like ipecac, promises to clear the teeth of amebas,
there is no excuse for neglecting nature’s adornment.</p>

<h3 id="LOWERING_MILK_GRADE">LOWERING THE MILK GRADE</h3>

<p>A bill has been introduced in the Minnesota
State Legislature for the purpose of lowering
the butterfat requirement in milk from three
and one-quarter to three per cent. This means
a reduction of solids in milk from thirteen to
eleven per cent, and it further means that more
water will be added to much of the milk sold in
Minnesota. A Minneapolis ordinance prescribes
the butterfat content to be as high as three and
one-half per cent. Minneapolis has enough water
in its milk now, and, if this bill goes through,
the city may expect to use skim-milk almost exclusively.</p>

<p>It hardly seems credible that any one should
desire the quality of milk to be reduced for any
purpose whatever unless it is for commercial
reasons.</p>

<p>Fortunately, at this writing the bill is held up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
for consideration, and it is to be hoped that sufficient
pressure will be brought to bear to insure
its defeat. Too many cows give poor milk and
any effort to standardize and legalize the inferior
cow is a reflection on the integrity of milk sellers.
Inferentially, there are too many under-fed children
and yet if milk is reduced in quality, we
must expect less vigor in the growing child.</p>

<p>One wonders why such a bill should get into
the Legislature; what are the real reasons for
its passage?</p>

<h3 id="LEAVES_OF_HEALING">“LEAVES OF HEALING!”</h3>

<p>The late issue of “Leaves of Healing,” published
by the Dowieites at Zion City, near Chicago,
has been sent broadcast among physicians.
This sheet is an antivaccination propaganda,
and is profusely illustrated by horrible pictures
of supposed diseased states caused by vaccination.
The text is, as is all others of its ilk, full
of misinformation, garbled extracts from known
and unknown writers and speakers, and tirades
against all who believe in vaccination.</p>

<p>If these sheets would present a fair and broad
view of the evils of vaccination they might find
more adherents to antivaccination doctrines
among medical men; but, as it contains so many
misstatements and is so overbearingly one-sided
in its efforts, the effect is nil, except when it is
circulated among those unbalanced in mind and
judgment. Physicians in general freely acknowledge
that vaccination, or the introduction of a
serum, may produce, in some people, unexpected
and sometimes disastrous results. Most physicians
hesitate to vaccinate people with active
syphilis, or even those in whom the syphilis has
been seemingly inactive for years, or those
who have hereditary syphilis. These persons are
quite apt to have an accentuation of their old
blood disorder under slight infections or injuries;
but that should not militate against vaccination
when an epidemic is probable. Some of the pictures
in “Leaves of Healing” were undoubtedly
pictures of syphilis, and should have been so
labeled; but that could not have been expected in
a partisan publication.</p>

<p>Physicians also know that people who have
chronic eczema should not be vaccinated until
the eczema clears up; and doubtless in hurried
or extensive vaccinations that are deemed necessary
to prevent the spread of smallpox in a community
cases of eczema are overlooked. Children
who are the victims of chronic digestive
disorders, or who react to mild febrile or diarrheal
conditions more than the average child, are
commonly exempted from vaccination. On the
whole, there are but few conditions that are made
worse by careful vaccinations with proper dressings
and after-care.</p>

<p>When one considers what wonders in the way
of control of smallpox have been recorded in
medical history, the few mishaps that occur
among the vaccinated, the proportion of illness
due to vaccination is so infinitesimal that they
cannot be classed among the “fearful” results of
vaccination.</p>

<p>“Leaves of Healing” leaves out of its vaporings
the fact that Zion City had a smallpox epidemic
not long ago, and was quarantined by the health
authorities, and that the people submitted to vaccination
with gratifying results. Nor does the
above-mentioned magazine record the fact that
the president and secretary of a local branch of
antivaccinationists in Minneapolis, who were
fighting a compulsory vaccination law before the
Minnesota Legislature a few years ago, died of
virulent smallpox during that meeting of the
Legislature.</p>

<p>The antivaccinationist usually has at his command
a set form of speech that contains more
vituperant adjectives, and less reason and judgment,
than the average self-constituted reformer.
Smallpox and other preventable diseases will continue
to exist while the uneducated and ill-balanced
minds are permitted their volley of wind-laden
speech. Some day the people will wake up,
cast the “reformer” aside, and climb on to the
band-wagon of health and happiness.</p>

<p>It will take our educators and sanitarians some
time to harness the team to the wagon, but when
it starts it will go on merrily to its destination.</p>

<h3 id="OWNERSHIP">OWNERSHIP OF THE JOURNAL-LANCET</h3>

<p>In answer to a number of inquiries the following
statement is made:</p>

<p>The stock of the <span class="smcap">Journal-Lancet</span> is held by
a number of Twin City physicians, and the publisher,
Mr. W. L. Klein.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Journal-Lancet</span> is the official organ of
the State Medical Associations of Minnesota,
North Dakota, and South Dakota. The responsibility

<p><span class="smcap">To the Physicians of the State of Minnesota</span>:</p>
</div>

<p>The Committee on Public Policy and Legislation
most earnestly asks the co-operation of
every physician in the State of Minnesota in procuring
the passage of the several bills that have
been decided upon, and either have been or will
be introduced into the legislature during this
session. It is believed that there is not a man
upon the roster of the State Medical Society, or
indeed any physician in Minnesota, who does not
see the necessity of certain legislation for the
protection of the physicians in the State, and
also that the common weal will be advanced
by the passage of the telephone bill introduced
by Senator Andrews, of Blue Earth, and
by the passage of the bill relative to trachoma,
which is a constant menace to the public health,
and several other bills that are in course of preparation,
but which await certain developments
before their presentation. The committee earnestly
begs of all the physicians in the State that
they will write to their representatives and senators
from time to time urging with great earnestness
their support for the several measures
advanced by the Committee on Public Policy and
Legislation. It is believed that every physician
can influence at least from 10 to 100 votes at a
general election, and this fact, of itself, makes
the physician a factor in the election of any candidate.
It is believed by this committee that the
medical men of the State, if they will but unite
and act in concert, can measurably influence legislation.
The time has come for the physician to
take his place in the political system of the State,
both as an active agent and, indirectly, through
his influence of others.</p>

<p>The telephone bill provides for physical connection
between all telephone companies in the
State without extra charge, except a small toll.
It provides that telephone companies shall be
placed under the direction of the Railroad and
Warehouse Commission. It provides that no
greater net income than 5 per cent shall be allowed
upon the capital actually used in the operation
of the telephone companies. It provides
for intercity telephone service in the cities whose
city limits adjoin without extra charge.</p>

<p>The trachoma bill provides for the segregation
of trachomats, and, under certain circumstances,
for the maintenance by the State of special
schools for their education in school districts
having as many as 20 trachomats.</p>

<p>There is also drafted and ready for introduction
a bill requiring all persons who seek to
practice medicine in any form whatever to pass
the regular examination before the State Board
of Medical Examiners.</p>

<p>There is in contemplation a bill for the purpose
of procuring certain lands for the building
of cottages thereupon and establishing farms to
be worked by lepers who may be or shall have
been committed to the leprosarium farm, the intention
being that those lepers in the State that
are able to work shall have an opportunity to do
so, and that the said lepers should care for lepers
who are unable to work or earn a living. It is
also proposed to purchase a small tract of land
not far from the State University for the purpose
of allowing an exhaustive study of certain forms
of leprosy with the aid of the State University
Medical Staff. The leprosarium farm would be
under the direction of the State Agricultural
School.</p>

<h3>MINNESOTA ACADEMY OF MEDICINE</h3>

<p>The Academy met at the St. Paul University
Club, Feb. 3. Dr. C. M. Carlaw presided.</p>

<p>Four doctors were proposed for membership:
Drs. W. H. Condit and Stephen Baxter, of Minneapolis,
and Drs. Wilhelm Lerche and F. C.
Schuldt, of St. Paul. All four names were referred
to the executive committee.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold Schwyzer showed some x-ray pictures
of a penetrating gastric ulcer. He also
made a report of a case where gall-stones gave a
feeling of emphysematous crackling, due to small
marble-sized stones with no more fluid than
enough to fill the spaces between the stones (perhaps
a teaspoonful in all).</p>

<p>The paper of the evening was presented by
Dr. A. E. Benjamin, the subject being “Goiter
Operations with Simplified Technic.” The paper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
was thoroughly discussed, the whole evening
being given over to its consideration.</p>

<p>The reading of Dr. White’s thesis was deferred
until another meeting.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven were present.</p>

<span class="smcap">To the Editor</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>In the February 15th issue of <span class="smcap">The Journal-Lancet</span>
is a discussion by Dr. Klaveness, of
Sioux Falls, S. D., on a paper on “Syphilis and
Its Relation to Society” by Dr. McLaughlin, of
Sioux City, Iowa. In this discussion Dr. Klaveness
states: “We are unfortunate here in South
Dakota in this respect, that we do not have the
population and the laboratory facilities for resorting
to the Wassermann reaction at all times,
and any man within the State who would systematically
carry out a Wassermann reaction
now and then would invalidate his findings very
materially, inasmuch as it is very well established
that, in order to obtain reliable readings, you
must have a serologist or bacteriologist to follow
this work exclusively in order to get accurate
findings. It is immensely important, and it
would be a boon to the suffering people, if we
could have a state serologist.”</p>

<p>This statement by Dr. Klaveness is contrary to
the facts as they now exist and did exist at the
time he discussed the paper at Watertown, S. D.,
in May, 1914.</p>

<p>We have a well equipped medical laboratory in
South Dakota in connection with the medical department
at the State University at Vermillion,
and we have been doing the Wassermann test.</p>

<p>This misstatement should have been corrected
at the time it was made, but was not, as I was in
Watertown but part of one day during the State
Meeting last May and did not hear the paper or
its discussion.</p>

<p>Permit me to state through your columns that
we do the Wassermann test at the State Health
Laboratory and have been doing it on Thursday
of each week since March 21, 1914. At that
time a circular letter announcing the fact was
sent to every physician in the State, including
Dr. Klaveness. This announcement was made
only after several months of experimental work
in perfecting the technic and controlling all factors.</p>

<p>We do the original Wassermann test, using
the Nogouchi antigen. All our reagents are prepared
in our laboratory and every possible control
is carried out each time the test is set up.
We therefore believe that our results will compare
favorably with the best scientific work of
this character.</p>

<p>At the present time a fee of $5.00 for each
test is charged, containers and instructions are
supplied upon request.</p>

<p>We have done the Wassermann test for the
State Hospital for the Insane at Yankton from
the first.</p>

<h3>THE LOYALTY OF NURSES</h3>

<p>
<span class="smcap">To the Editor:</span>
</p>

<p>My attention has just been called to an article
published in <span class="smcap">The Journal-Lancet</span>, August 1,
1914, it being an address by Dr. George D. Head
to the graduating class of the Asbury Hospital.
The advice Dr. Head gives to the nurses seems
very good, and very elevating to our profession,
but I would like to analyze it to show that it is
not quite practical.</p>

<p>It has taken considerable effort on the part of
nurses to convince the people, and to convince
some doctors, that they are any more than machines.
Because we ask for three hours rest out
of the twenty-four, and because we asked for a
fixed rate for service, Dr. Head says that our
loyalty to high ideals is diminishing. Unfortunately,
in the nursing profession, as in all other
professions, there are some who are incapable
and unconscientious; and, if Dr. Head had the
experience of having a nurse leave a patient, unattended,
at a critical time, she probably was one
of the few incapables, or was so overtired from
loss of sleep that it was necessary for her to have
rest. When Dr. Head says that a nurse should
waive her rest hours for days or a week at a
time, if necessary, I think he is making a mistake.
A nurse cannot do her duty by a patient if she
does not have proper rest. It is unfair to both
the patient and the nurse. Dr. Head may say
that most patients are not in need of constant
attention for more than a few days or a week,
and that a nurse can stand it for that length of
time without rest hours. This is true; but we
have to consider that the next case may be just
as critical, and so the nurse must reserve some
strength for the cases to follow. And more
often than not, the nurse is obliged to take cases
with very little or no rest between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>In the second place, Dr. Head thinks that the
nurses ought to have a varying scale of charges
for service. The doctors do it; why shouldn’t
the nurses? Dr. Head does not seem to consider
the fact that the nurse has one patient, while the
doctor has many. Suppose a nurse takes care of
a poor patient for five or ten dollars a week,
where is the rich patient who is willing to pay
forty or fifty dollars a week to make up the loss?
The nurses have found that twenty-five dollars
a week is the price that is necessary for them to
live on in order to keep themselves clothed, pay
for their laundry (no small item), and carry them
over the few weeks of rest or over the dull season.
The average life of a nurse, as a nurse, is,
I believe, not more than ten years. In that length
of time, at the wages she gets, she is not able to
lay away a great amount for a rainy day, which
usually comes all too soon.</p>

<p>We have a number of good hospitals in Minneapolis
where people in moderate circumstances
can be very comfortably cared for at a considerably
less expense than employing a nurse in
their homes. The poor in our city, I think, are
fairly well taken care of in the city hospitals and
by the visiting nurses, who are paid for such
work.</p>

<p>As for nurses refusing cases because they are
afraid of them: I think there is usually some
just cause. If a nurse has a tendency towards
tuberculosis, she should refuse such cases; or
if she has a tendency towards throat troubles, she
should refuse diphtheria and scarlet-fever cases.
A nurse who is constantly with a patient runs
considerably more risk of infection than the physician,
whose visits are usually short. There are
nurses who make a specialty of such cases, and
usually there is no trouble finding such a nurse.
Nurses who make a specialty of obstetrical cases
or of children should not take contagious work.
As for a nurse refusing a typhoid case because
she is afraid of it: I cannot believe that any
real nurse would do such a thing.</p>

<p>It also seems to me very ridiculous, and it
surely cannot be a common thing for a nurse to
inquire before she consents to take a case whether
or not the plumbing is modern and how many
servants are kept.</p>

<p>As to just what Dr. Head means by saying
that a nurse should be willing to do any kind
of service about a house. I do not know; but I
do know that nurses are not usually physically
fit for washing or scrubbing, yet, as a rule, nurses
are glad to perform duties which are not just in
their line, in order to help the household to run
smoothly.</p>

<p>Most of the nurses in general work are engaged
in nursing because they are obliged to
earn their living, and in most cases because they
are especially interested in this particular field;
and, although most nurses take some charity
cases, it is impossible for them to take many,
even to satisfy what Dr. Head calls “the inner,
higher longings of the soul.”</p>

of the Heart.</span> By Prof. Dr. Theodor Schott, Bad-Nauheim.
Published by Blakiston, Philadelphia.
Price, $2.50.</p>

<p>This brochure sets forth in the main, preceded by a
short chapter on medical treatment, the philosophy,
technic, and clinical results of balneogymnastic therapy
in chronic heart-conditions.</p>

<p>It would appear, inasmuch as Prof. Schott admits the
non-establishment of the probable curative factors of
either the carbon dioxide or mineral constituents, that
possibly, as Dr. Anders in the foreword surmises, the
curative properties may reside in the “advantage of being
far removed from the cares and responsibilities growing
out of the practical affairs of life at home.”</p>

<p>Relative to the more firmly established value of the
gymnastic element, it is quite evident that the “resistance
movements,” are an improvement over the Zander
mechanico-gymnastic, and of similar value to the so-called
“Terrain Kur,” with the added advantage of personal
application.</p>

M. D., 220 pages, 94 illustrations. Surgery Publishing
Co., N. Y. Price, cloth. $2.00.</p>

<p>Few men are better fitted than Dr. Ely to write an
authoritative book on joint and bone diseases. He has
gone at his study from the only logical end; that is,
the study of the underlying pathology. The book
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
throughout shows the result of much conscientious work
in the pathological and x-ray laboratories, carefully
checked up from the clinical aspect.</p>

<p>The average specialist who writes a manual for the
use of the general practitioner seems to think he must
mention every theory which has ever been brought out
since the time of Hippocrates, together with a list of
every form of treatment ever proposed. The bewildered
family doctor gets about as much help as he would from
the perusal of a few pages of the Index Medicus. One
good theory, clearly stated, even if it is not universally
accepted, may form a practical working basis which will
be of great aid to the doctor in the understanding and
care of his cases. In this particular Dr. Ely is most
satisfactory. He has worked out the pathology of the
tubercular and other chronic joint diseases in a clear and
logical manner. While much may have to be altered
in the light of further research, at least one can feel
sure that Dr. Ely has convictions, and that his work
will form a useful basis for further investigations.</p>

<p>The illustrations are taken almost entirely from photographs
or photomicrographs and are mostly original. So
many works on Orthopedic Surgery appear which are
filled with cuts handed down from one text-book to
another, cuts of impossible people wearing impossible
appliances, that it is hard to imagine that such a book,
illustrated with such quaint old prints, can represent the
latest word or offer anything new.</p>

<p>Dr. Ely’s discussion of the pathology of joint tuberculosis
is perhaps the most interesting thing in the book.
His idea of the red bone marrow and the synovia being
the sole tissues to be primarily involved does not agree
with the recent work of Fraser, of Edinburgh. Evidently
more work must be done in order to harmonize
these findings.</p>

<p>In general, while not much space is given to treatment,
what there is, is clear and is carefully selected by
the author, instead of leaving this important point to the
discretion of the reader.</p>

<p>His discussion of the chronic arthritides is quite full
and very instructive. He points out particularly the resemblance
between the pathological conditions found in
various chronic infectious joints and in the various
stages of joint tuberculosis.</p>

<p>This little book will certainly be of use to anyone who
has to treat bone and joint diseases.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Battle Creek Method in Diabetes</h2>
</div>

<p>Diabetes, though not always curable, is controllable. Practically
all diabetics can be made sugar-free and the acidosis disappears
with the sugar. By a special regimen the reappearance of the
sugar and the acidosis may be prevented.</p>

<p>The Battle Creek method is based upon experience gained in the treatment of many
hundreds of cases supplemented by the observations and discoveries of Von Noorden,
Falta, Guelpa, Benedict, Allen, and numerous other investigators. The essential
features of the method are&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A thorough preliminary examination and repeated examinations comprising (a)
complete quantitative examination of the urine daily, (b) differential study of the blood,
(c) chemical, microscopic and bacteriological examination of the feces and study of the
pancreatic function, (d) X-ray examination of the stomach and intestine with special
reference to stasis.</p>

<p>2. Study of the patient’s metabolism by the respiration apparatus to determine his
respiratory quotient, CO<sub>2</sub> tension and basal ratio.</p>

<p>3. Establishment, by the aid of metabolism studies of each case, of a regimen adapted
to the individual by determining the proper proportion of protein, fats and carbohydrates
to keep the urine free from sugar. The kind of protein, fat and carbohydrate
is considered important, as well as the amount.</p>

<p>4. The patient’s metabolism is regulated by baths, voluntary and automatic exercise,
photo- and thermotherapy and other physiologic means.</p>

<p>5. The results of the regimen and treatment are accurately controlled by a “Metabolism
Graphic” which shows the daily variations in the amount of urine, amount of sugar,
acidosis, coefficient of sugar utilization, coefficient of carbohydrate utilization, nitrogen
balance, glucose nitrogen ratio, weight balance and energy balance. These factors
are all worked out by expert chemists and dietitians and with this data before
him, and a great variety of special foods of known energy value suited
to diabetics at ready command, and the assistance of a strong corps of
specially trained dietitians, the physician is able easily to arrange a dietary adapted
to each case and to note each patient’s progress with the most careful scrutiny.</p>

<p>Under this comprehensive management the sugar usually disappears from the
urine in two or three days, and does not return so long as the prescribed
regimen is followed.</p>

<p>A few weeks’ treatment usually suffices to train the patient to a suitable
dietary which he may safely follow under the guidance of his home
physician.</p>

Creek Method in Diabetes to any physician who will mail

<h3>BOREMETINE&mdash;A NEW EMETINE PREPARATION
FOR PYORRHEA</h3>

<p>Every doctor and dentist in the United States should
know about this new preparation for the local treatment
of pyorrhea alveolaris. Boremetine is a 1-2 per
cent solution of emetine hydrochloride, together with
boric acid, zinc sulphocarbolate, and aromatics.</p>

<p>The emetine is amebicidal, the boric acid bactericidal,
and the zinc sulphocarbolate astringent. These three
drugs meet the three essential factors necessary for the
successful treatment of pyorrhea. Boremetine should
be used in every case, either alone, or (in some severe
cases) in association with the subcutaneous injection of
Emetine Hydrochloride (Abbott).</p>

<p>A special free booklet on “Pyorrhea Alveolaris: How
to treat it successfully with Emetine” will be sent on

<h3>OCONOMOWOC HEALTH RESORT</h3>

<p>The State of Wisconsin has an enviable reputation for
not a few things in which it excels all the other western
or middle-western states. One of these is its sanatoriums,
or health resorts. The climate, the beautiful
scenery, the pure water, the proximity to the large cities
of Milwaukee and Chicago, and the high-grade medical
specialists made it possible to found such institutions
in southern Wisconsin long before other parts of the
middle west had the population or transportation facilities
to make success in this line either probable or possible.</p>

<p>The Oconomowoc Health Resort is one of the best
equipped and best managed of these institutions. It
accepts only nervous and mild mental cases. It is under
the management of Dr. Arthur W. Rogers as resident
physician. Dr. Rogers has both the professional equipment
and the personality that are necessary in the treatment
and care of persons suffering from nervous and
mental disorders.</p>

<h3>BATTLE CREEK SANITARIUM</h3>

<p>Fifty years ago examination was largely a matter of
pulse finding; now it is possible to weigh and measure
the organic functions of the body with as much accuracy
as is possible in the testing of an intricate mechanism.
This becomes possible through a series of tests in many
of which elaborate equipment is required. Perhaps no
other institution has a more complete organization for
diagnosis than the Battle Creek Sanitarium.</p>

<p>The physical inventory possible there is a very thorough
and accurate stock taking of the vital functions.
Many business and professional men visit the sanitarium
each year in order to take full advantage of the diagnostic
facilities.</p>

<p>An interesting booklet, “The Measure of a Man,” is
offered free by the sanitarium to those who care to know
more regarding the system of examination.</p>

<h3>ARMOUR &amp; COMPANY</h3>

<p>Why Pituitary Liquid should be specified:</p>

<p>It is a pure preparation.</p>

<p>It is free from objectionable chemicals.</p>

<p>It is made from absolutely fresh raw glands. It does
not require preservatives.</p>

<p>It is standardized physiologically.</p>

<p>It is sold in dated packages, permitting the physician
to discard old goods.</p>

<p>Pituitary Liquid is required in such particular classes
of cases that the practitioner can afford to use the best
only.</p>

<p>The use of Pituitary Liquid obviates the necessity of
forceps in a great many cases.</p>

<p>Pituitary Liquid is of great service in parturition
uterine inertia&mdash;peristalic paralysis.</p>

<p>We shall be pleased to send you a sample of Pituitary
Liquid with literature.</p>

<p>Note the name of the perfect pituitary preparation&mdash;<i>Pituitary
Liquid (Armour)</i>.</p>

<h3>THE DELICATE SCHOOL GIRL</h3>

<p>Even the most robust and generally healthy children
show the deleterious results of the modern system of
educational “forcing” that prevails in most of our larger
cities. The child that starts the school year in excellent
physical condition, after the freedom and fresh air
of the summer vacation, in many instances, becomes
nervous, fidgety, and more or less anemic, as the term
progresses, as the combined result of mental strain and
physical confinement in overheated, poorly ventilated
school-rooms. How much more likely is such a result
in the case of the delicate, high-strung, sensitively
organized, adolescent girl? It is certainly a great mistake
to allow such a girl to continue under high mental
pressure, at the expense of her physical health and well-being,
and every available means should be resorted to
to conserve the vitality and prevent a nervous breakdown.
Regularity of meals, plenty of sleep, out-of-door
exercise without fatigue, open windows at night and
plenty of nutritious food, should all be supplied. Just
as soon as an anemic pallor is noticeable, it is a good
plan to order Pepto-Mangan (Gude) for a week or two,
or as long as necessary to bring about an improvement
in the blood state, and a restoration of color to the
skin and visible mucous membranes. This efficient
hematinic is especially serviceable in such cases, because
it does not in the least interfere with the digestion nor
induce a constipated habit.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
